if having issues exiting, spam esc a lot..it helps. is that, the

## Updates!ðŸ”§

1.6.177013:

Fix the script Runtime by removing `sh` and use `./` instead, it will then rely at `#!/bin/env bash`, not `sh` to continue

Updaters are fixed... *maybe*

In the future there will be option to not back up the old version while updating.

Fix Debian when exiting the info, gets prompt `go.sh: command not found`

Remove `egg.bf`
