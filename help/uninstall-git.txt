Uninstall GIT

This area will try to uninstall
this GIT

You will be met by a Dialog that will 
try to remove the Script (Uninstaller works -
When on $HOME Directory)

Continuing the Removal will then make the
current Version be deleted.. Older ones at your
$HOME Dir will be stuck so you
have to rm them..
